    "### Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression** is a type of linear regression that adds a regularization term (penalty) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It aims to minimize the residual sum of squares while shrinking the regression coefficients to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Difference from OLS**: Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, reducing the impact of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients. OLS does not have this regularization, and it may lead to overfitting in the presence of highly correlated features."

    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the target variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of the error terms.\n",
    "4. **No exact multicollinearity**: Ridge can handle multicollinearity to some extent, but if two predictors are perfectly collinear, it still fails.\n",
    "5. **Normality of errors**: Residuals are normally distributed, though Ridge is somewhat robust to violations of this assumption."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, just like in OLS regression. However, due to the regularization term, the coefficients are shrunk compared to OLS, meaning they are biased but have lower variance.\n",
    "- The magnitude of the coefficients is typically smaller because the regularization term penalizes large values. The interpretation remains the same: the coefficient indicates how much the dependent variable is expected to change with a unit change in the predictor, holding other variables constant."
